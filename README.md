# Project_EnergyHarvest_Predict_OilProdCum_
This project exhibit ML performance for predicting the oil production in a water-flooding reservoir. The data was generated from 1000 simulation runs with parameterizing rock properties and well controlling schedule, and our goal is to use these attributes to infer the ultimate oil production after 10 years and also the yearly oil production. This project be chosen as The Winner on KAUST HACKATHON 2022.

# Data
